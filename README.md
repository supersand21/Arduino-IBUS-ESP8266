# Arduino-IBUS-ESP8266
Some example code that can read an IBUS serial signal and get channel values using SoftwareSerial and no external libraries.
Reliability is questionable though.

This code was tested using a FS-iA6B reciever and an ESP8266.
Considering how raw the example code is, it is likely to work with other arduino compatible microcontrollers, but has not been tested with them.
